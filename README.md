# ISLR-python-notebooks
Python notebooks for exercises in An Introduction to Statistical Learning by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani

[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) (ISLR) by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani contains support for R programming. I have prepared python notebeooks for selected exercises using [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Scikit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/). Early sections of ISLR discuss p-values. Scikit Learn does not support p-values. Instead, I skipped p-values and later intoduced a discussed of confidence intervals computed using the bootstrap method.
